"""
Example of key derivation with 24-words mnemonic phrase in the same way of Brave crypto wallets extension (legacy).

The old version of Brave crypto wallets extension (now referred as "legacy") worked differently from BIP39 when a 24-words mnemonic phrase was used.
In fact, instead of computing the seed from the mnemonic as described in BIP39, it used the initial entropy directly as seed.
Therefore, the derived keys and addresses were completely different to other wallets.
